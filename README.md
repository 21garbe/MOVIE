This repository contains the project of Virtual Reality we made during the second year of our curriculum at les Mines de Paris. It is a software to learn rookies how to box by learning him some basic moves. This project was made collaborating with "Le Théâtre du Montfort" of Paris and with the help of the France champion of Box Sofia Nabet.
